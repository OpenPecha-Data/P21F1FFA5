The pramāṇas are not established by themselves or by one another or by other pramāṇas. Nor are
they established by the prameyas, or accidentally.

Perception is not established by that very perception, inference is not established by that
very inference, identification is not established by that very identification, and testimony
is not established by that very testimony.Nor are they established by one another, i.e.,
perception by inference, identification and testimony, inference by perception, identification
and testimony, identification by perception, inference and testimony, and testimony
by perception, inference and identification. Nor are perception, inference, identification
and testimony established, respectively, by another perception, another inference, another
identification, and another testimony.Nor are the pramāṇas established by the prameyas,
taken collectively or individually, each pramāṇa being established either by the corresponding
prameya or by the other prameyas too.Nor are they established accidentally. Nor again
are they established by a combination of the causes mentioned before, whatever their number:
twenty, thirty, forty or twenty-six.-In these circumstances, your statement: ‘Because
the things to be cognized are to be apprehended through the means of true cognition, those
things to be cognized exist as well as those means of true cognition through which those
things to be cognized are apprehended’, is not valid.
