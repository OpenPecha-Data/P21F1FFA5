Now, if [you think] that intrinsic nature of the good things originates without depending on
anything, then there would be no practice of religious life.

Now, if you think that the good intrinsic nature of the good things originates without depending
on anything, and that the same is true of the bad intrinsic nature of the bad things
and of the indeterminate intrinsic nature of the indeterminate things, then there is no practice
of religious life.- Why? - Because, if this is so, one rejects Dependent Origination.
By rejecting Dependent Origination, one rejects the vision of Dependent Origination.For
if Dependent Origination does not exist, there can be no question of its vision. If there
is no vision of Dependent Origination, there is no vision of Dharma.For the Lord has said:‘0
monks, he who sees the pratītyasamutpāda sees the Dharma’.[And] if one does not see the
Dharma, there is no practice of religious life. Or, rejecting Dependent Origination, one
rejects the origination of sorrow. For Dependent Origination is the origination of sorrow.By
rejecting the origination of sorrow, one rejects sorrow. For, if there is no origination,
how will that sorrow originate?If sorrow and [its] origination are rejected, then the
cessation of sorrow is rejected. For if there is no origination of sorrow, what will come
to cease through abandonment?[And] if the cessation of sorrow is rejected, the Way is rejected.
For, if there is no cessation of sorrow, for obtaining what will there be a way to the
cessation of sorrow?Thus, the Four Noble Truths will cease to exist. If they do not exist,
there is no result of monasticism.For it is through the vision of [those.] Truths that
the results of monasticism are attained. [And] if the results of monasticism do not exist,
there is no practice of religious life.
