Furthermore:We have already established the voidness of all things. This criticism, therefore,
turns out to be one of something which is not a proposition.

Here we have already established in detail the voidness of all things. Even the name has already
been stated to be void.Now you, assuming non-voidness, have returned to the charge. If
the things had nointrinsic nature, then even the name ‘absence of intrinsic nature’would
not exist. Your criticism, therefore, turns out to be one of something which is not a proposition.
We do not say, indeed, that the name is existent.
