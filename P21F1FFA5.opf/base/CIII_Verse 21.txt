If my statement does not exist in the combination of the cause and the conditions, or independently
of them, then the voidness of the things is established because of their being devoid
of an intrinsic nature.

If my statement does not exist in its cause and in its conditions ...,it is devoid of an intrinsic
nature and thus void. Now the voidness of this statement of mine is established because
of its being devoid of an intrinsic nature.And just as this statement of mine is void
because of its being devoid of an intrinsic nature, so also are all things void because of
their being devoid of an intrinsic nature.In these circumstances, your statement: ‘Because
of the voidness of your statement it is not possible to establish the voidness of all things’,
is not valid.
