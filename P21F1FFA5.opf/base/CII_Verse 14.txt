But this being so, the aggregate of the six following things exists: the perception, the object
to be perceived, the perceiver of that object, the negation, the object to be negated,
and the negation.

If this is so, then the perception of people, the object to be perceived, people who perceive
it, the negation of that wrong perception, the object to be negated, viz., the wrong perception,
and people like you who negate this perception - all these exist. The aggregate of
the six is, therefore, established.[And] that aggregate of the six being established, your
statement that all things are void is not valid.
