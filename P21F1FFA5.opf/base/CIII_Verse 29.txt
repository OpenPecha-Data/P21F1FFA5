If I had any proposition , then this defect would be mine. I have, however, no proposition.
Therefore, there is no defect that is mine.

If I had any proposition, then the defect previously stated by you would be mine, because it
would affect the specific character of my proposition. [But] I have no proposition.Thus [we
observe:] When all things are void, perfectly appeased and by nature isolated, how can
there be a proposition?How can something affect the specific character of a proposition? [And]
how can there be a defect, caused by the fact of affecting the specific character of
a proposition?- In these circumstances, your statement: ‘The defect is only yours because
it affects the specific character of your proposition’, is not valid.
