It is not possible to hold that the negation comes first and then the thing to be negated. Nor
is it possible to hold that the negation comes after [the thing to be negated], or that
they are simultaneous. - The intrinsic nature of the things is, therefore, existent.

It is not possible to hold that the negation comes first and then the thing to be negated. For,
if the thing to be negated does not exist, of what is the negation?Nor is it possible
to hold that the negation comes after the thing to be negated. For, if the thing to be negated
is [already] established, what purpose is served by the negation?Now [if you say that]
the negation and the thing to be negated are simultaneous, [we answer]: even in that way,
the negation is not the cause of the object to be negated, nor is the object to be negated
the cause of the negation,just as of the two horns, grown simultaneously, the right horn
is not the cause of the left horn, nor is the left horn the cause of the right horn.- In
these circumstances, your statement that all things are void is not valid.
