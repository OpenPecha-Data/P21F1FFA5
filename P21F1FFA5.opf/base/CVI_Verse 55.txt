Furthermore:There would be neither merit nor demerit nor the worldly conventions . All things,
being endowed with an intrinsic nature, would be permanent - for that which has no cause
is permanent.

If this is so, what defect follows for you who reject DependentOrigination?- There is no merit.
There is no demerit. Nor do exist the worldly conventions. - Why? -Because all that is
dependently originated; how will it be, if there is no dependent origination?Moreover, being
endowed with an intrinsic nature, not dependently originated and devoid of a cause, it
would be permanent. - Why? -Because things that have no cause are permanent.- There would
thus follow that very non-practice of religious life. And you would contradict your own tenet-
Why? - Because the Lord has taught that all conditioned things are impermanent. They
become permanent, because they are [Supposed to be] endowed with an intrinsic nature and
hence [to be] permanent.
