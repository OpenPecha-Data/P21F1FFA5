Furthermore:If the good intrinsic nature originates dependently it is an extrinsic nature of
the good things.How can it be thus their intrinsic nature?

If the intrinsic nature of the good things originates in dependence upon the cause-condition
complex, how can it, being born of an extrinsic nature, be the intrinsic nature of the good
things?The same holds true of the bad and other things. â€“ In these circumstances, your
statement that the good intrinsic nature of the good things has been explained, as well as
the bad intrinsic nature of the bad things, and so on, is not valid.
