Furthermore:If that perception were by its own nature, who would remove that perception? The
same method applies to the rest [of the things] too. Hence this is a non-criticism.

If the perception of water in a mirage were by its own nature, who indeed would remove it?For
an intrinsic nature cannot be: e.g., the heat of fire, the fluidity of water, the openness
of space’. Its removal, however, is seen.The intrinsic nature of the perception is, therefore,
void. The same method is to be understood with regard to the rest of the things, viz.,
the five things beginning with the object to be perceived- In these circumstances, your
statement that all things are non-void because of the existence of’ the aggregate of the
six, is not valid.
