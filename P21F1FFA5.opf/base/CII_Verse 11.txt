Furthermore: Since the negation ’There is no pot in the house’ is seen to be only of an existent,
this negation of yours is that of an existent intrinsic nature.

It is only an existent object that is negated, not a non-existent one, For instance, when it
is said: ‘There is no pot in the house’, it is an existent pot that is negated, not a non-existent
one.In like manner it follows that the negation ‘The things have no intrinsic nature’
is the negation of an existent intrinsic nature, not of a non-existent one.In these
circumstances, the statement that all things are devoid of an intrinsic nature is not valid.
By the very fact that a negation is possible, the intrinsic nature of all things is non-negated.
