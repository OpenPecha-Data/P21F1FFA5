In our refutation of perception, we have [already] refuted inference, verbal testimony and identification,
as well as the objects to be established by inference, verbal testimony and
identification.

We have [already] refuted inference, identification and verbal testimony, in our refutation
of the ‘instrument of true cognition’, perception. Just as perception, an ‘instrument of true
cognition’, is void because all things are void, so also are inference, identification
and verbal testimony void because all things are void.Those objects which are to be established
by inference, verbal testimony and identification, are also void because all things
are void.The person who apprehends the things through inference, identification and verbal
testimony, is also void. Thus, there is no apprehension of things, and a negation of the
intrinsic nature of things that are not apprehended is a logical impossibility. In these
circumstances, your statement that all things are void is not valid.
