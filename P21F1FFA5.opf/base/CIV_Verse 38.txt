It is wrong to say that fire illuminates in the very process of its origination. For, in the
very process of its origination, fire does not come in contact with darkness.

The opinion that fire, in the very process of its origination, illuminates both other things
and itself is not tenable. - Why? -Because, in the very process of its origination, fire
does not come in contact with darkness; since it does not come in contact with it, it does
not destroy it; and since darkness is not destroyed, there is no illumination.
