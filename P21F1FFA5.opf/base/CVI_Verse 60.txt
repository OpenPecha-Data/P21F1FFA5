‘Now [you may say:] There is an intrinsic nature, but that does not belong to the things’ -
this suspicion of yours is not shared by us.

We do not, indeed, deny the intrinsic nature of the things. Nor do we affirm the intrinsic nature
of a certain object apart from the things.Now, this being so, your criticism: ‘If the
things are devoid of an intrinsic nature, you should explain to what other object, apart
from thethings, there now happens to belong the intrinsic nature, is thrown far away. It
is no criticism at all.
