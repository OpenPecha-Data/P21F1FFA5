Moreover: Now you may say: There is an intrinsic nature, but that does not belong to the things.
There is, then, an intrinsic nature without the things, and you should explain to what
it belongs.

Now you may fancy: Let there be no name without an object; there is an intrinsic nature, but
that does not belong to the things; thus, the voidness of the things because of their being
devoid of an intrinsic nature will be established, and the name will not be without an
object [to be named ].- To this we reply:You should explain that object, apart from the things,
to which now belongs thus that intrinsic nature. You have, however, not explained that.Hence
your assumption: ‘there is an intrinsic nature but it does not belong to the things’,
is ruled out.
