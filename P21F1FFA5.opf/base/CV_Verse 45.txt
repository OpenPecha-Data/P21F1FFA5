Besides, if you establish the pramāṇas in relation to the prameyas, then there is certainly
an interchange of pramāṇas and prameyas.

Moreover, if you think, in order to avoid the defect stated before, that the ‘means of true
cognition’ exist only in relation to the ‘objects to be cognized’, then there is an interchange
of pramāṇas and prameyas.Your pramāṇas become prameyas, because they are established
by the prameyas. And the prameyas become pramāṇas, because they establish the pramāṇas.
