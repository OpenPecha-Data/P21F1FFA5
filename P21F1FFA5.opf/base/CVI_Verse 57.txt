He who says that the name is existent, deserves indeed the answer from you: ‘There is an intrinsic
nature". We, however, do not say that.

He who says that the name is existent, deserves the answer from you: ‘There is an intrinsic
nature’. That intrinsic nature, which is designated by the existent name, must also be, for
that reason, existent.For a non-existent intrinsic nature cannot have anexistent name. We,
however, do not say that the name is existent. Since the things have no intrinsic nature,
that name also is devoid of an intrinsic nature. For that reason, it is void, and, being
void, it is non-existent.- In these circumstances, your statement that because of the existence
of the name the intrinsic nature I’s existent, is not valid.
