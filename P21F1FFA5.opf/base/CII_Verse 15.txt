You may think that there is no perception, no object to be perceived, and no perceiver. But,
in that case, there is no negation, no object to be negated, and no negator.

If, in order to avoid this defect, you say that there is no perception, no object to be perceived,
and no perceiver, then even the negation of the perception, viz., the statement that
all things are void, does not exist. The object to be negated and the negators, too, do
not exist.
