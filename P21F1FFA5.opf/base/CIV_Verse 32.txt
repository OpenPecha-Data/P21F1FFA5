Neither the beginning nor the middle nor the end can then be established.

If there is an infinite series, the beginning cannot be established. - Why? - Because those
pramāṇas are established through other pramāṇas, and those others again through other pramāṇas.
Thus there is no beginning.[And] if there is no beginning, how can there be a middle?
How can there be an end?Consequently, the statement that those pramāṇas are established
through other pramāṇas is not valid.
