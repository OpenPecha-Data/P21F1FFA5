Tell me which of these is the father, and which other the son. Both of them bear, indeed, the
marks of a father and that of a son, wherefore we have a doubt here.

Of that father and that son, mentioned before, which is the son, and which other the father?Both
of them, as producers, bear the mark of a father, and, as produced, the mark of a son.
We have a doubt here: which of these is the father, and which other the son?In just the
same manner, of these pramāṇas and prameyas of yours, which are the pramāṇas, and which others
the prameyas?For both of these, as those which establish, are pramāṇas, and as those
which are to be established, prameyas. We have a doubt here as to which of these are the pramāṇas,
and which others the prameyas.
