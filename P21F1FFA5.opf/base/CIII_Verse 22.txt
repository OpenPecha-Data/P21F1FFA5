FurthermoreThat nature of the things which is dependent is called voidness, for that nature
which is dependent is devoid of an intrinsic nature.

You have not understood the meaning of the voidness of the things. So you have set out to criticize
me, saying: ‘Since your statement is devoid of an intrinsic nature, the negation of
the intrinsic nature of the things is not valid’.That nature of the things which is dependent
is voidness.- Why - Because it is devoid of an intrinsic nature. Those things which
are dependently originated are not, indeed, endowed with an intrinsic nature; for they have
no intrinsic nature.- Why? - Because they are dependent on causes and conditions. If the
things were by their own nature, they would be even without the aggregate of causes and conditions.But
they are not so. Therefore they are said to be devoid of an intrinsic nature,
and hence void.Likewise it follows that my statement also, being dependently originated,
is devoid of an intrinsic nature, and hence void.- But things like a cart, a pot, a cloth,
etc., though devoid of an intrinsic nature because of being dependently originated, are
occupied with their respective functions, e.g., carrying wood, grass and earth, containing
honey, water and milk, and protecting from cold, wind and heat.Similarly this statement of
mine, though devoid of an intrinsic nature because of being dependently originated, is engaged
in the task of establishing the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature of the things.-
In these circumstances, your statement: ‘Your statement, being devoid of an intrinsic nature,
is void, and, being void, it cannot negate the intrinsic nature of all things’, is not
valid.
