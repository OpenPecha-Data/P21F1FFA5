If the son is to be produced by the father, and if that father is to be produced by that very
son, tell me which of these produces which other.

Supposing somebody said: the son is to be produced by the father, and that father is to be produced
by that very son, tell me who is to be produced by whom.In exactly the same manner
you say: the prameyas are to be established by the pramāṇas, and those very pramāṇas in turn
are to be established by those very prameyas. Now, which of these are to be established
for you by which others?
