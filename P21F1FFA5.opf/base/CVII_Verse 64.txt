Regarding your assertion that the statement of the negation of the non-existent is established
without words, we observe: Here speech makes it known as n on-existent, it does not deny
it.

Regarding your statement: ‘The negation of the non-existent is established even without words;
what purpose is, therefore, served by your statement “All things are devoid of an intrinsic
nature” we observe:The statement: ‘All things are devoid of an intrinsic nature’, does
not make all things devoid of an intrinsic nature.But, since there is no intrinsic nature,
it makes known that the things are devoid of an intrinsic nature.Here is an example: While
Devadatta is not in the house, somebody says that Devadatta is in the house. On that occasion,
somebody tells him in reply: ‘He is not [in the house]’.That statement does not create
Devadatta’s non-existence, but only makes known Devadatta’s non-existence in the house.Similarly
the statement ‘things have no intrinsic nature’ does not create the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature
of the things, but makes known the absence of an intrinsic nature
in all things.- In these circumstances, your statement: ‘If there is no intrinsic nature,
what purpose is served by the statement “There is no intrinsic nature”? The absence of
an intrinsic nature is established even without words’, is not appropriate.
