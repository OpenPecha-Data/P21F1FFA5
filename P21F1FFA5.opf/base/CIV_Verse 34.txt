This is a defective proposition. Fire does not illuminate itself, for its non-perception is
not seen to be comparable to that of a pot in darkness.

Your proposition that the pramāṇas establish themselves as well as other things like fire [that
illuminates itself as well as other things] is defective. For fire does not illuminate
itself.A pot, not illuminated by fire, is first not perceived in darkness. Then, being illuminated
by fire, it is perceived. If, in the same manner, fire, not being illuminated, first
existed in darkness and then were illuminated, it would be possible to say: it illuminates
itself.This, however, is not the case. Thus this assumption, too, is not valid.
