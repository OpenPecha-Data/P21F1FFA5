All things prevail for him, for whom prevails this voidness. Nothing prevails for him for whom
voidness does not prevail.

For whom this voidness prevails, for him all things - mundane and supramundane - prevail. -
Why? -Because Dependent Origination prevails for him for whom voidness prevails. The Four
Noble Truths prevail for him for whom Dependent Orignation prevails. The results of monastic
life as well as all special acquisitions prevail for him whom the Four Noble Truths prevail.The
Three Jewels, viz., the Buddha, the Dharma and the Saṃgha, prevail for him for whom
all the special acquisitions prevail.For whom Dependent Origination prevails, for him merit,
the cause of merit, the result of merit, demerit, the cause of demerit, the result of
demerit, - all these prevail.For whom merit and demerit, the causes of merit and demerit
and the results merit and demerit prevail, for him passion, the origination of passion, and
the objective grounds of passion prevail.For whom all that prevails, for him the law concerning
the happy and the unhappy states, the attainment of those states, the way leading
to those states, the act of passing beyond those states, the means of passing beyond those
states, and all worldly conventions are established.They are to be understood individually
by each person, following this direction: a part [only] can be taught in words.I adore
that incomparable Buddha who taught Voidness, Dependent Origination and the Middle Way as
equivalent.

Here ends this work of the venerable master Nāgārjuna.
