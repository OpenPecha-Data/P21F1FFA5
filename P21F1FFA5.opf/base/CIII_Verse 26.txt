Because, if things devoid of an intrinsic nature were prevented by something devoid of an intrinsic
nature, with the cessation of [their] being devoid of an intrinsic nature would be
established [their] being endowed with an intrinsic nature.

This example would be appropriate if by a statement devoid of an intrinsic nature were prevented
things devoid of an intrinsic nature - as by the sound: ‘Do not make a sound’ is prevented
another sound.Here, however, by a statement devoid of an intrinsic nature is negated
the intrinsic nature of the things. If by a statement devoid of an intrinsic nature were
negated the things’ being devoid of an intrinsic nature, the things, by the very fact of being
negated in their quality of being devoid of an intrinsic nature would be endowed with
an intrinsic nature.Being endowed with an intrinsic nature, they would be non-void. We, however,
declare that the things are void, not that they are non-void. This, therefore, is
a non-example.
