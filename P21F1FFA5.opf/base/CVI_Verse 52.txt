If people conversant with the state of things say that the good things have a good intrinsic
nature, that has to be stated in detail.

People conversant with the state of things think that the good things have a good intrinsic
nature. But that has to be stated by you in detail:this is that good intrinsic nature; these
are those good things; this is that good consciousness; this is that intrinsic nature of
the good consciousness, and so on.This, however, is not seen to be soThus your statement
that the intrinsic nature of each individual thing has been explained is not valid.
