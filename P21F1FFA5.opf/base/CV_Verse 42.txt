[The opponent may reply:] If it is admitted that they are established in relation [to the objects
to be cognized], what defect is there? - [The defect is that] what is [already] established
is established [again]. For something that is not established does not require something
else.

If it is admitted that the ‘means of true cognition’ are established in relation to the ‘objects
to be cognized’, then the four ‘means of true cognition’, which are [already] established,
are established [anew].- Why? -Because an object that is not established does not require
something else. For instance, Devadatta, who is not [yet] established, does not require
anything whatever.But it is not admissible that something that is [already] established
be established [anew]. One does not do something that is [already] done.
