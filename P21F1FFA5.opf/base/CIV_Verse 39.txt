Or, if fire destroyed darkness even without coming in contact with it, then this fire, standing
here, would destroy darkness in all the worlds.

Or, if you think that fire destroys darkness even without coming in contact with it, then this
fire, standing here at this moment, will equally destroy the darkness existing in all the
worlds, without coming in contact with it.This, however, is not seen to be the case. Thus,
your opinion that fire destroys darkness even without coming in contact with it is not
valid.
