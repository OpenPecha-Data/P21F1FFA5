Or this reason is similar in nature to the thesis to be established, for sound has no [real]
existence. We do not speak, however, without having recourse to the conventional truth.

The reason ‘It is like ‘‘Do not make a sound’’’ is of the same nature as the thesis to be established
- Why? - Because all things, being devoid of an intrinsic nature, are alike.That
sound, being dependently originated, has no existence by its own nature. [And] since it has
no existence by its own nature, your statement: ‘For here a sound that is existent prevents
the other sound that will be’, is precluded.It is not, however, without having recourse
to the conventional truth, it is not by rejecting the conventional truth, that we say:
All things are void.For it is not possible to teach the absolute truth without having recourse
to the conventional truth. As it is said: ‘The transcendent truth cannot be taught without
having recourse to the conventional truth. [And] Nirvāṇa cannot be attained without
realizing the transcendent truth’Thus, all things are void like my statement, and that all
things are devoid of an intrinsic nature, follows in both ways [i.e., both by virtue of the
‘reason’ and of the thesis to be established]’.Now about your statement [contained in v.
