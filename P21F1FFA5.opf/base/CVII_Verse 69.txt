We have already answered [the question relating to] the reason [for a negation] in the three
times, for the case is the same. And a counter-reason for the three times is obtained for
the upholders of the doctrine of voidness.

It has to be understood that the question why a negation is possible in the three times has
already received. -Why? -Because the reason is of the same nature as the thesis to be established.To
explain: In virtue of your statement, a negation is not possible in the three times,
and, like the negation, the thing to be negated, also, does not exist. Thus, there being
no negation and no object to be negated, your opinion that the negation has been negated,
is untenable.That very reason which expresses a negation of the three times is obtained
for the upholders of the doctrine of voidness, for they negate the intrinsic nature of
all things, - not for you.Or it has been answered in the following way: ‘I do not negate anything,
nor is there anything to be negated. You, therefore, calumniate me when you say:
“You negate”’.Now, if you think: the negation is established in all the three; we see the
antecedent cause, the subsequent cause, and the simultaneous cause: antecedent cause, e.g.,
the father as the cause of the son; subsequent cause, e.g., the disciple as the cause of
the teacher; simultaneous cause, e.g., the lamp as the cause of the light,- we reply: this
is not so. For in this way are stated the three former defects.Moreover, if this is so,
you admit the existence of a negation, and you abandon your proposition. The negation of an
intrinsic nature is also established in this way.
