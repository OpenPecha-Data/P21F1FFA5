If the things had no intrinsic nature, then even the name ‘absence of intrinsic nature’ would
not exist; for there is no name without an object [to be named].

If all things were devoid of an intrinsic nature, there would, nevertheless, be an absence of
intrinsic nature. [But] then, even the name ‘absence of intrinsic nature’ would not exist.-
Why? - Because there is no name whatsoever without an object [to be named].Thus, since
the name exists, there is an intrinsic nature of the things; and since they have an intrinsic
nature, all things are non-void.Your statement, therefore, that all things are devoid
of an intrinsic nature and that, being devoid of an intrinsic nature, they are void, is not
valid.
