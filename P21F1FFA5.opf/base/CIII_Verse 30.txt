If I apprehended something with the help of perception, etc., then I would either affirm or
deny. [But] since that thing does not exist, I am not to blame.

If I apprehended something with the help of the four pramāṇas, viz., perception, inference,
identification and verbal testimony, or with the help of one of these, then only would I either
affirm or deny.[But] since I do not even apprehend an object of any kind, I neither
affirm nor deny.In these circumstances, your criticism: ‘If [you say that] you deny the things
after having apprehended them through one of the pramāṇas, viz., perception, etc., [we
reply:] those pramāṇas do not exist, nor do exist the objects to be apprehended through
them’, does not concern me at all.
