Furthermore:Your ‘reason’ [for establishing your thesis] cannot be established. How can there
be, indeed, a ‘reason’ for you, when everything is devoid of an intrinsic nature? And this
thesis of yours which is devoid of a ‘reason’, cannot be established.

Your reason for the thesis that all things are devoid of an intrinsic nature cannot be established.
- Why? –Because all things, being devoid of an intrinsic nature, are void. How, therefore,
can there be a reason? [And] if there is no reason, how indeed can the thesis devoid
of a reason, namely that all things are void, be established?- In these circumstances,
your statement that all things are void is not valid.
