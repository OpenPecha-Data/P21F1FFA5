This statement is not endowed with an intrinsic nature. There is therefore no abandonment of
position on my part. There is no discordance, and [hence] there is no special reason to be
stated.

This statement of mine, being dependently originated, is not endowed with an intrinsic nature.
As previously stated, since it is not endowed with an intrinsic nature, it is void.And
since this statement of mine is void, just as all other things are void, there is no discordance.For,
there would be a discordance [only] if we said: This statement is non-void, while
all other things are void. We, however, do not say that. There is, therefore, no discordance.And
since the following discordance, this statement is non-void while all other things
are void, does not exist, we do not have to state the special reason: for this reason
this statement is non-void while all [other] things are void.- In these circumstances, your
statement: ‘There is on your part an abandonment of position, there is a discordance, and
you should state the special reason’, is not valid.(noe english)
