Besides: If the pramāṇas are at all events established in relation to the prameyas, the prameyas
are not established in relation to the pramāṇas.

If the pramāṇas are established in relation to the prameyas, then the prameyas are not established
in relation to the pramāṇas. - Why? -Because the object to be established does not
establish the instrument by which it is established. The pramāṇas, however, it is said, are
the instruments by which the prameyas are established.
