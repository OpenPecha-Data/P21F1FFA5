If an intrinsic nature of things, whatever they may be, exists nowhere, your [very] statement
must be devoid of an intrinsic nature. It is not, therefore, in a position to deny the intrinsic
nature [of the things].

Whether in the causes, in the conditions, in the combination of the causes and the conditions,
or in a different thing, nowhere does exist an intrinsic nature of the things, whatever
they may be. On this ground it is said that all things are void.For instance, the sprout
is neither in the seed, its cause, nor in the things known as its conditions, viz., earth,
water, fire, wind, etc., taken one by one, nor in the totality of the conditions, nor in
the combination of the causes and the conditions, nor is it anything different from the causes
and the conditions.Since there is nowhere an intrinsic nature, the sprout is devoid of
an intrinsic nature. Being devoid of an intrinsic nature, it is void.And just as this sprout
is devoid of an intrinsic nature and hence void, so also are all the things.Here we observe:
if this is so, your statement that all things are void, must also be void.- why? -
because your statement is neither in its cause - the [four] great elements, taken collectively
or individually; - nor in its conditions, the efforts made in the breast, the throat,
the lips, the tongue, the roots of the teeth, the palate, the nose, the head, etc.; nor
in the combination of both [the cause and the condition]; - nor again is it anything apart
from the cause and the conditions.Since it is nowhere, it is devoid of an intrinsic nature,
[and] since it is devoid of an intrinsic nature, it is void. For this reason, it is incapable
of denying the intrinsic nature of all things.A fire that does not exist cannot burn,
a weapon that does not exist cannot cut, water that does not exist cannot moisten; similarly
a statement that does not exist cannot deny the intrinsic nature of all things. In these
circumstances, your statement that the intrinsic nature of all things has been denied,
is not valid.
