Besides:I do not negate anything, nor is there anything to be negated. You, therefore, calumniate
me when you say: ‘You negate’.

Even that you could rightly say, if I negated something. I, however, do not negate anything,
for there is nothing to be negated.Thus, while, all things being void, there is neither a
thing to be negated nor a negation, you make an absurd calumny when you say: ‘You negate’.
