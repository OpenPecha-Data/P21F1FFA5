If you think that the same holds true of the negation of the negation also, that is false. It
is your proposition which by virtue of its specific character is thus rendered defective,
not mine.

You may think: ’According to this very method a negation of negation also is impossible; so
your negation of the statement negating the intrinsic nature of all things is impossible’.-To
this we reply: This also is false. - Why ? - Because the objection applies [only] to the
specific character of your proposition, not to that of mine. It is you who say that all
things are void, not I. The initial thesis is not mine. - In these circumstances, your staternent
that, such being the case, a negation of negation also is impossible, is not valid.
