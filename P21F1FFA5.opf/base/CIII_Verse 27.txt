Or suppose that an artificial person should prevent the false notion of somebody who with regard
to an artificial woman thinks: ‘This is a woman’. This would be like that.

Or suppose that in an artificial woman, void of an intrinsic nature, some man should have the
false notion that it is really a woman and, as a result of that false notion, should feel
desire for her.The Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata would [then] create an artificial
man [and] the latter would dispel the false notion of that man, through the power of
the Tathāgata or of the disciple of the Tathāgata.Likewise, by my void statement, comparable
to the artificial man, is prevented the idea of an intrinsic nature in all things which
are devoid of an intrinsic nature and comparable to the artificial woman.Thus, this is an
appropriate example for establishing voidness, not the other one.
