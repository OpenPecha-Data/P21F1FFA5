Moreover: If you think that it is like ’Do not make a sound’, [we reply:] this also is not valid.
For here a sound that is existent prevents the other sound that will be.

You may think: When somebody says: ’Do not make a sound’, he himself makes a sound, and that
sound prevents the other sound; in just the same manner, the void statement that all things
are void prevents the intrinsic nature of all things.-To this we reply: This also is not
valid. - Why ? - Because here a sound that is existent negates the future sound.In your
case, however, it is not an existent statement that negates the intrinsic nature of all things.
For, in your opinion the statement is non-existent, the intrinsic nature of all things
is non-existent. Thus, it is like "Do not make a sound" is a defective proposition.
