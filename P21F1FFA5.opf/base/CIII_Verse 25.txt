The example given by you: ‘It is like “Do not make a sound” is not appropriate. There a sound
is prevented by another sound, but the case here is not just the same.

This example, moreover, is not ours. That void statement does not prevent voidness as a person,
when he says: ‘Do not make a sound’, makes a sound and at the same time prevents a sound.-
Why? - Because, in this example, a sound is prevented by another sound. But the case
here is not the same.We say: all things are devoid of an intrinsic nature, and hence void.-
