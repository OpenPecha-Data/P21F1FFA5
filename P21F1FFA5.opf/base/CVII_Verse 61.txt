If [it is true that] negation is only of an existent, then this voidness is established - for
you negate the things’ being devoid of an intrinsic nature.

If negation is only of the existent and not of the non-existent, and if you negate the being-devoid
of-an-intrinsic-nature of all things, then the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature
of all things is established.Since, in virtue of your statement, negation exists’, and since
the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature of all things has been negated, voidness is established.
