Furthermore:If such and such objects are established for you through the pramāṇas, tell me how
those pramāṇas are established for you.

If you think that such and such ‘objects of true cognition’ are established through the ‘instruments
of true cognition’, just as the things to be measured are established through the
measuring instruments, [we ask:] How are those ‘instruments of true cognition’, viz., perception,
inference, identification and verbal testimony, established?If [you say that] the
pramāṇas are established without the help of pramāṇas, then [your] proposition that [all]
objects are established through pramāṇas is abandoned.If the pramāṇas are established through
other pramāṇas, then there is an infinite series. If you think that the ‘objects of true
cognition’ are established through the ‘means of true cognition’ and that those ‘means
of true cognition’ are established through other ‘means of true cognition’, then there follows
an infinite series - What harm is there if there is an infinite series?
