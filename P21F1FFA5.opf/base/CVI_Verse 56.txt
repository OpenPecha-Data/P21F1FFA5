there being no origination, no subsistence and no destruction, all that is conditioned
turns out to be unconditioned, because of the absence of the specific character ofâ€™ the
conditioned.In these circumstances, your statement that all things are non-void because the
good and other things have an intrinsic nature, is not valid.
